# History

ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML) is a dynamic web programming language, which is especially suited for new developers as it was written to make a programmer's job easy and not care if the computer's job is hard. In this brief introduction we'll look at key language features you need to get started.

ColdFusion (CFML) is an interpreted and dynamic language that compiles to Java Bytecode directly, thus running in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).  Implementations of the language are mostly done by two parties: [Adobe ColdFusion](http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html) (Commercial) and [Lucee Server](http://lucee.org/) (Free & Open Source).
