# History

ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML) is a dynamic web programming language, which is especially suited for new developers as it was written to make a programmer's job easy and not care if the computer's job is hard. In this brief introduction we'll look at key language features you need to get started.

ColdFusion (CFML) is an interpreted and dynamic language that compiles to Java Bytecode directly, thus running in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).  Implementations of the language are mostly done by two parties: [Adobe ColdFusion](http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html) (Commercial) and [Lucee Server](http://lucee.org/) (Free & Open Source).

## Working with ColdFusion

CommandBox is a standalone, native tool for Windows, Mac, and Linux that will provide you with a Command Line Interface (CLI) for developer productivity, tool interaction, package management, embedded CFML server, application scaffolding, and some sweet ASCII art. It seamlessly integrates to work with any of our *Box products but it is also open for extensibility for any ColdFusion (CFML) project as it is also written in ColdFusion (CFML) using our concepts of CommandBox Commands.  It tightly integrates with our contribution community; ForgeBox, so developers can share modules world-wide.
