# Comments

Comments are necessary and essential for any programming language.  CFML is no different with helping you add code comments in both script and tag syntax.


## Tags

You can use the `<!--- Comment --->` Syntax to comment within a CFML template. This is very similar to HTML comments but adding an extra `-` to demarcate it as a CFML comment.


```html

HTML Comment
<!-- I am an HTML Comment-->

ColdFusion Comment
<!---  I am a ColdFusion Comment--->

```
