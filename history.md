# History

ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML) is a dynamic web programming language, which is especially suited for new developers as it was written to make a programmer's job easy and not care if the computer's job is hard. In this brief introduction we'll look at key language features you need to get started.

ColdFusion (CFML) is an interpreted and dynamic language that compiles to Java Bytecode directly, thus running in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).  Implementations of the language are mostly done by two parties: [Adobe ColdFusion](http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html) (Commercial) and [Lucee Server](http://lucee.org/) (Free & Open Source).

## Working with ColdFusion

[CommandBox](https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox) is a standalone, native tool for Windows, Mac, and Linux that will provide you with a Command Line Interface (CLI) for developer productivity, tool interaction, package management, REPL, embedded CFML server, application scaffolding, and some sweet ASCII art. 

All examples shown in this book will be done leveraging CommandBox as the de-facto standard for ColdFusion (CFML) development.

## ColdFusion Docs Reference

The best way for discovering the methods, tags and functionality of the ColdFusion language is to leverage [cfdocs.org](https://cfdocs.org/).  Make sure you open it and bookmark it.
