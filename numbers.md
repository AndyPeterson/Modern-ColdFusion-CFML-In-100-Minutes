# Numbers

There are two basic kinds of numbers: **integers** (whole numbers) and **floats** (have a decimal point).  Internally, each CFML engine treats them in their own way.  However, all we must know is how to operate them with typical math operators: `+ `, `-`, `*`, `/`.  However, there are many mathematical member functions and mathematical functions available to you in CFML.
