# Numbers

There are two basic kinds of numbers: **integers** (whole numbers) and **floats** (have a decimal point).  Internally, each CFML engine treats them in their own way.  However, all we must know is how to operate them with typical math operators: `+ `, `-`, `*`, `/`.  However, there are many Java mathematical member functions and [mathematical functions](https://cfdocs.org/math-functions) available to you in CFML.
