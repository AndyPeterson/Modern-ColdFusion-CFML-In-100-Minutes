# Modern ColdFusion \(CFML\) in 100 Minutes

This book is inspired by the original [Ruby in 100 minutes](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html) and [Mike Henke's work on CFML in 100 minutes](https://github.com/mhenke/CFML-in-100-minutes/wiki).  The purpose of this book is to jumpstart developers into the ColdFusion \(CFML\) programming language from a modern perspective and a focus on best practices and object orientation.
