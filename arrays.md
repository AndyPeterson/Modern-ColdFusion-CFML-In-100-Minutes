# Arrays

Almost every programming language allows you to represent different types of collections.  In CFML we have to types of collections: arrays and structures.

An array is a number-indexed list. Imagine you had a blank piece of paper and drew a set of three small boxes in a line:


```
 ---  ---  ---
|   ||   ||   |
 ---  ---  ---
```

You could number each one by its position left to right:

```
 ---  ---  ---
|   ||   ||   |
 ---  ---  ---
  0    1    2
```

Then put strings in each box:

```
 -------------  ---------  ----------
| "Breakfast" || "Lunch" || "Dinner" |
 -------------  ---------  ----------
       0            1           2
```
