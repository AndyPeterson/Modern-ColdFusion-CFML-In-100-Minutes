## Installation

CommandBox is a Java-based executable that will run on most recent desktop operating systems (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows). Since it is a command line tool that uses a shell interface, it does not even require an operating system using a GUI. 

### Requirements

* 256MB+ RAM
* 250MB+ free hard drive space
* Multi-core CPU recommended
* JRE/JDK 7+

### Download

If you already have a Java JRE installed level 1.7 or higher (and set in
your environment variables) you can [download](http://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox#download) the non-JRE version for
your Operating System. If you don't have a JRE installed or aren't sure, we would recommend you [download](http://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox#download) the version with a JRE included.

Regardless of where you place the **box** binary, the first time you execute
it, a `.CommandBox` folder will be created in your user's home
directory and CommandBox will be extracted into that location. If you
delete this directory, it will be replaced the next time the CommandBox
executable is run.
