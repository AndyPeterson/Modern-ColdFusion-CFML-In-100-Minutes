# Components, Properties, and Methods

**ColdFusion (CFML) is object-oriented**

CFML is an Object-Oriented programming language which means that all the things we interact with inside the virtual machine are objects, which in our case we will call Components (CFCs). Each piece of data is an object. Objects hold information, called properties/fields, and they can perform actions, called methods.

> Remember that objects are not only data but data + behavior.
