# Components, Properties, and Methods

**ColdFusion (CFML) is object-oriented**

CFML is an Object-Oriented programming language which means that all the things we interact with inside the virtual machine are objects. Each piece of data is an object. Objects hold information, called properties/fields, and they can perform actions, called methods.

> Remember that objects are not only data but data + behavior.

For an example of an object, think about you as a human being. You have attributes like height, weight, and eye color. You have methods like "walk", "run", "wash dishes", and "daydream." Different types of objects have different attributes and methods. In the next sections weâ€™ll look at a few specific kinds of objects common in Ruby.
