# Beyond The Language

We cannot possibly cover all the features of the ColdFusion Engines in this book as our focus was more on the core CFML language and some advanced topics.  However, please note that the engines offer a tremendous middle-ware capabilities that extend beyond normal language features.  There are many areas that make ColdFusion one of the most \(if not the most\) rapid application development languages around.

Check out the [cfdocs](https://cfdocs.org/) and the engine documentation sites for all the different capabilities they can offer.  Below are just some of the capabilities the ColdFusion Engines offer:

* PDF Creation
* PDF Manipulation
* Database Introspection
* Object Relational Manager via Hibernate/JPA
* Stored Procedures Support
* Multiple JDBC Connectors
* Job Scheduling
* Server Monitoring
* API Monitoring, Caching, Gateway
* Exchange Support
* LDAP Support
* Spreadsheet Support
* Open Office Support
* Mathematical Functions
* OSGI Bundle Support
* Distributed Caching Support
* Much More!
