ColdFusion is an **interpreted** programming language which means it canâ€™t run on your processor directly, it has to be fed into a middleman called the Java Virtual Machine in the form of Java Bytecode. 

The ColdFusion engine will convert your markup into byte code and feed it into the Virtual Machine (VM) to execute it.  The benefit to this approach is that you can write ColdFusion code once and, typically, execute it on many different operating systems and hardware platforms.

You can run any ColdFusion script in any Adobe or Lucee server or in the command line with CommandBox.
