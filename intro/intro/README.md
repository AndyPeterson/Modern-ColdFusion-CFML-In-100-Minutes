# Welcome

Welcome to the wonderful world of dynamic programming with ColdFusion \(CFML\).  The purpose of this book is to jump start developers into the ColdFusion \(CFML\) programming language from a modern perspective and a focus on best practices, object orientation and tooling.  ColdFusion is not the same as it was 20 years ago, yes it's more than 20 years old!  It's dynamic, vibrant, modern, fluent, and functional!  Let's begin our adventure into the world of MODERN ColdFusion \(CFML\).

{% hint style="info" %}
This book is inspired by the original [Ruby in 100 minutes](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html), [Mike Henke's work on CFML in 100 minutes](https://github.com/mhenke/CFML-in-100-minutes/wiki) and [Learn CF in a week series](http://www.learncfinaweek.com/).

## ColdFusion vs CFML

Let's get this ambiguity out of the way.  ColdFusion is the server product and CFML is the language, short for ColdFusion Markup Language.  In turn, ColdFusion is actually the platform or the framework where CFML scripts are executed in. It is similar to the relationship between HTML and a web browser like IE, Firefox, or Safari.
